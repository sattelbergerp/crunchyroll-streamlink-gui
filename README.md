### About
A simple gui for opening crunchyroll streams in streamlink. Streamlink is a contuation of livestreamer. Streamlink must be used as livestreamer is abandoned and no longer works with crunchyroll.

### Video Players
From my testing mpv is the only player that provides a decent experience. VLC works however it reports the length of the video as 00:00 and has tendancy to randomly stop playback forcing you to reopen the episode. By default the player is mpv but this can be changed in the settings. On windows this must be changed to point to the full path of the player you are using even if it's mpv.
